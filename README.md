# My process
The body was made a flex container to align the QR box right in the center of the screen as well as have responsiveness. Inside the body a main div which emcompassess all the elemnts of the QR namely, the image and the div containing the heading and the text content, is given a display of flex column to stack everything on top of each other. The image has an overall margin on all sides. The subdiv with text context is also given a flex property and appropiriate margins to align in the center. To get a similar result as the original question posted, both the heading and the text is given a maximum width so as to not overflow
